## Mission Statement

Provide a practical and user-friendly application that provides individuals with a means to communicate and reach out to those they would like to stay in more contact with.
## Problem

Technology has been a wonderful tool for helping people make connections with others. Unfortunately, the ease with which we make these connections can lead to having too many people to keep in contact with, and inevitably we fail to adequately maintain all of our relationships. We do a decent job of keeping in touch with the people we see regularly in our lives, but the longer it's been since we’ve seen a friend, the harder it is to continue thinking about them and stay in contact. For many, it can be difficult to figure out how to reach out to someone after not talking for a long time, or how to interpret a slow or absent response.

Existing social media platforms are all profit-motivated, which inevitably leads to anti-consumer design choices made to boost ad revenue and sell users’ data, instead of enriching people’s lives. How can we make an app that helps us remember the people we connect with, learn skills for deepening connections, and prompt us to reach out for more meaningful interactions?  

## Installation and Build Process
The initial installation process for our react application assumes that you will have each of the following installed previous: 
  - Installation of git on you machine, which can be confirmed through the use of the "git --version" command, or downloaded directly throught the following link: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
  - Installation of Node on your machine, which can be confirmed through the use of the "npm --version" command. If it does not currently exist, proceed to the following: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - Installation of VS Code or any alternative compatible IDE. Can be installed through https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  - In accordance with standard web development procedure, once within vs code, proceed to install both the "prettier" and "eslint" extensions onto your machine. 
  - Once all of the above has been completed, proceed to navigate into either a new folder or an appropriate pre-existing         folder to install your react dependencies in. Once completed, proceed to run "npx create-react-app <Folder-Name>"
  - If you wish to test out your newly installed dependencies, within powershell ensure you are in the correct directory and     proceed to run "npm start" or "yam start"
